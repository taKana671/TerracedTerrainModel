# TerracedTerrain

This repository uses the meandering triangles algorithm to create a 3D model of spherical or flat terraced terrain. 
For spherical terrain, a base sphere is created by repeatedly subdividing each face of the cube into triangles and normalizing the distance from the center to each vertex. For flat terrain, a ground is created by repeatedly dividing a polygon into triangles. And noise such as simplex and cellular is used to calculate the height of each vertex. 
Then, the meandering triangles algorithm is used to form a staircase-like terrain.
The terrain is colored by setting color information directly to the vertices.
In addition, by running `terraced_terrain_editor.py`, you can create a 3D model while checking how the terrain changes depending on the parameters.

# References

The meandering triangles algorithm is based on below:
* https://icospheric.com/blog/2016/07/17/making-terraced-terrain/
* https://blog.lslabs.dev/posts/ttg
  
# Requirements

* Panda3D 1.10.15
* numpy 2.2.4
* Cython 3.0.12
* opencv-contrib-python 4.11.0.86
* opencv-python 4.11.0.86
  
# Environment

* Python 3.13
* Windows11

# Usage

### Clone this repository with submodule.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/taKana671/TerracedTerrainModel.git
```

### Build cython code.

If cytnon code is not built, noise is calculated using python code.
```
cd TerracedTerrainModel
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

If the error like "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘distutils’" occurs, install the setuptools.
```
pip install setuptools
```

### Code sample

Create an instance of TerracedTerrainGenerator and call the create method to return the panda3D's NodePath of the terrain's 3D model. 
If you use the class methods from_simplex, from_cellular, or from_perlin, you do not need to specify noise among the following [parameters](#parameters).

```
from terraced_terrain_generator import TerracedTerrainGenerator

generator = TerracedTerrainGenerator.from_simplex()     # SimplexNoise is specified.
# generator = TerracedTerrainGenerator.from_cellular()  # CellularNoise is specified.
# generator = TerracedTerrainGenerator.from_perlin()    # PerlinNoise is specified.
# generator = TerracedTerrainGenerator.from_fractal()   # SimplexFractalNoise is specified.

model = generator.create()
```

### Parameters

* _noise: func_
  * Function that generates noise.

* _scale: float_
  * The smaller this value is, the more sparse the noise becomes; default value is 10.
    
* _segs_s: int_
  * The number of vertices in the polygon that forms the ground; minimum is 3; defalut is 5.

* _radius: float_
  * Length from the center of the polygon forming the ground to each vertex; default is 3.

* _max_depth: int_
  * The number of times that triangles, formed by the center point and each vertex of the ground polygon, are further divided into triangles; default is 6.

* _octaves: int_
  * The number of loops to calculate the height of the vertex coordinates; default is 3.

* theme: str_
  * one of "mountain", "snowmountain" and "desert"; default is mountain.
 
### Usage of terraced_terrain_editor.py

Run terraced_terrain_editor.py and select the terrain type, noise and theme. 
If you want to change the parameters, edit the values in the entry boxes and click the [reflet] button.

```
python terraced_terrain_editor.py
```
